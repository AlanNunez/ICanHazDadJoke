## Overview

ICanHazDadJoke is a single screen application that retrieves and display jokes to the users.

## Project

The project was setup to target iPhones only. Furthermore, icons, splash images, and other basic details were included to simulate a production app to some extend.

## Design

Even though this is a vanilla application, the `MVVM` architecture was chosen over the MVC or MVP in favor of testability, and less dependent components.

## TODO

The implementation of the remaining endpoints to fetch a specific dad joke, fetch as an image, search term, and filter. 

Improve code coverage, and an overall refactoring to improve naming, remove boilerplates, and potential failure points, etc.
