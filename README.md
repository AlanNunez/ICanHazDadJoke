## Project

The project was setup to target iPhones only. Furthermore, icons, splash images, and other basic details were included.

## Design

Even though this is a vanilla application, the `MVVM` architecture was chosen over the MVC or MVP in favor of testability, and less dependent components. 

## TODO

The implementation of the remaining endpoints to fetch a specific dad joke, fetch as an image, search term, and filter. 

Improve code coverage, and an overall refactoring to improve naming, remove boilerplates, and potential failure points, etc.

Implement the 'text/html' and 'text/plain' content types.
